# Problem 

The proposed theme fits into the model of a fictitious library whose main objective is reservations and requests by members. As such, it was named after LMS - Library Management System. 
Its objective is to help the organization through its inevitable growth. 
This process involves developing a database capable of storing all the information considered relevant in a robust way, which is capable of guaranteeing the integrity, consistency and security of the data. The DBMS chosen for the development and maintenance of the database was SQL Server Management.
